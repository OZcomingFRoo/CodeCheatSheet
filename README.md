# CodeCheatSheet
A public repo used for quick reference.

This project will be public to use for working environment and job positions tests.
This project is not meant to allow fraud developers to get into the high-tech industry.
Potentially, I wish that for all to memorize some of the basic stuff used for quick refernce.
In addition to the basic tools in OOP Languages and Frameworks, This project also contains advance stuff that would not usually be implamented in work environment.

_____________________________________________________________________

What the project mainly contains:

## Utility functions and tools

The utility features are functions and tools that usually don't come in the built-in Framework and Programing Language (e.g. C# and Angular).
These can be copy and paste into a current project that requires a tool that is needed on the fly

## Quick reference examples

Gives an example + an explanation on how to use a feature from a Framework like Angular and Entity Framework.

## Guides and README files (md types)

Files in md format that give an examplaning to a section of the Framework on how it was setup in a way that is best suited for me, mostly.
