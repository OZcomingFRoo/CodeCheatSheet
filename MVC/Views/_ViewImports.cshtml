    - If set on the "Views", then all views will know about the classes these namespaces contain
    - Used purely to add all the "using" of classes and methods (e.g. TagHelper)
    - You cannot render Html Here or run some code before the View is rendered
      That's a job for the _ViewStart.cshtml to do.
